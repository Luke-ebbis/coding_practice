"""Needleman Wunch algorithm algorithm
author --- Sibbe Bakker
description --- An implementation of the needleman wunch alignment algorithm.
    This algorithm is a global alignment algorithm, it works best for comparing
    sequences of equal length. For simple complexity alignments, such as short
    sequences, or a small amount of sequences, this programme works adiquatly,
    but for a large amount of iterations (<1000Ã—) this script is too slow to be
    practical.
usage
    Here I describe the useage:
    sequence_X --
    sequence_Y --
source --- The aligner script written by YGC (2008; guangchuangyu@gmail.com).
    I refactored  into python code myself.
